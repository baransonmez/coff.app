# Coff.app - Clean Architecture
This project is a sample implementation for demonstrating the power of Clean Architecture written in GO.

## Motivation
My purpose in creating this project is to try a clean architecture implementation in Go language. Thanks to Clean Architecture, I aimed to develop a more manageable application by separating business rules and infrastructure dependencies.
